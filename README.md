│   ├── services/api.js     # Backend API integration
│   ├── styles/GlobalStyles.js # Theme & styled components
│   ├── App.jsx            # Main application

```

## 🚀 **Quick Start:**

1. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Server runs on http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Start the backend (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   # API runs on http://localhost:3001
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001

## 🎯 **Available Scripts**

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## 🔧 **Configuration Required:**

Before running, you'll need to:
1. Set up your AWS S3 credentials in the backend `.env` file
2. Create an S3 bucket
3. Configure the backend with your AWS settings

## 🌟 **Key Features You Can Use:**
- Upload multiple files with drag & drop
- Create and navigate folders
- Download files securely
- Delete files and folders
- Beautiful, responsive interface
- Real-time feedback and notifications
- Lightning-fast development with Vite HMR

## ⚡ **Why Vite?**

We converted from Create React App to Vite because:

- **🚀 Faster Development**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is instant
- **📦 Smaller Bundle**: More efficient bundling with Rollup
- **🔧 Better DX**: Simpler configuration and faster builds
- **🌟 Modern**: Native ES modules support
- **⚡ Lightning Fast**: Cold start in milliseconds vs seconds

## 🎨 **Styling Architecture**

The app uses a comprehensive design system built with styled-components:

- **Theme System**: Consistent colors, spacing, and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card)
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- **Modern CSS**: Latest CSS features with styled-components

## 🌐 **Environment Configuration**

Create a `.env` file in the frontend root for custom configuration:

```env
# Backend API URL (optional, defaults to http://localhost:3001/api)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# Other Vite environment variables (must start with VITE_)
VITE_APP_TITLE=Secure File Storage
```

**Note**: Vite uses `VITE_` prefix for environment variables instead of `REACT_APP_`

## 📱 **Browser Support**

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## 🔧 **Development Tips**

### Working with Vite:
- Environment variables must start with `VITE_`
- Use `import.meta.env` instead of `process.env`
- Hot reload is instant - no page refresh needed
- Build output goes to `dist/` folder

### Component Development:
- All components use `.jsx` extension
- PropTypes not included (can be added if needed)
- Modern JavaScript features are supported out of the box

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### Build for Production:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

### Preview Production Build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deployment Options:
1. **Static Hosting** (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
2. **CDN** (CloudFront, CloudFlare)
3. **Traditional Hosting** (Apache, Nginx)

### Environment Variables for Production:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/api
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

1. **Vite Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Vite will automatically try the next available port
   # Or specify a different port in vite.config.js
   ```

2. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Make sure they start with `VITE_`
   - Use `import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME`

3. **API Connection Errors**
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 3001
   - Check proxy configuration in `vite.config.js`
   - Verify CORS settings in backend

4. **Build Errors**
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for code issues
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure all imports use `.jsx` extensions

## 🔄 **Migration from TypeScript/CRA**

This project was successfully converted from:
- ✅ Create React App → Vite
- ✅ TypeScript → Modern JavaScript
- ✅ Faster development experience
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ✅ Better performance

## 🛠️ **Development Workflow**

1. Run `npm run dev` for development
2. Make changes to components in `src/`
3. Changes are reflected instantly with HMR
4. Use `npm run build` to test production builds
5. Deploy `dist/` folder to your hosting provider

## 📊 **Performance**

- **Development**: Lightning fast with Vite HMR
- **Build**: Optimized with Rollup
- **Bundle**: Tree-shaken and minified
- **Runtime**: React 18 with concurrent features
